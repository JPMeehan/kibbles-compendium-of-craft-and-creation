    value: >-
      <p>You develop a method to suddenly mutate. As a bonus action, you can
      become a Large-sized creature. Creatures of your choice within 30 feet of
      you that witness this must make a Wisdom Save against your spell save DC
      or become frightened of you until the end of their turn.</p>

      <p>While you are large, you deal 1d4 additional damage with your natural
      weapons and weapons sized for Medium creatures, and you have advantage on
      contested Strength (Athletics) checks against Large or smaller creatures.
      You can revert to normal size as a bonus action.</p>

      <p>You can spend a number of rounds equal to your Constitution modifier +
      your Intelligence modifier as a Large creature before you must revert and
      can not become Large again until you finish a short or long rest. After a
      short or long rest, you regain all rounds of duration you can remain as a
      large creature.</p>
