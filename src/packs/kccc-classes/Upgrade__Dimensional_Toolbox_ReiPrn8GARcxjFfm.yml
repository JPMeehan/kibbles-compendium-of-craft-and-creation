    value: >-
      <p>You build a toolbox, filling it with the many ideas you’ve had and
      discarded, with the magical power of making those ideas reality when you
      need them most. As an action, you can reach into the toolbox and withdraw
      an Unrestricted Upgrade of your choice (one with no level requirement)
      from the Gadgetsmith list. Gadgets withdrawn from the toolbox are
      fleeting, and disappear after 1 minute. Once you have with-drawn an
      upgrade from the toolbox, you can’t withdraw another upgrade from it until
      you finish a long rest.</p>
