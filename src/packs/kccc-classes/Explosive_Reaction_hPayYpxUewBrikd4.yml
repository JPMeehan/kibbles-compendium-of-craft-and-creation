    value: >-
      <p>As an action, you can produce an instant reaction, throwing a
      devastating combination of reagents at a point within 20 feet of you,
      which causes a minor explosion. Each creature within 10 feet of that point
      must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or
      take 1d10 thunder damage from the shockwave of the explosion.</p>

      <p>The damage increases by 1d10 when you reach 5th level (2d10), 11th
      level (3d10), and 17th level (4d10).</p>

      <p>Alternatively, you can use a bonus action to prepare this instant
      reaction as a ranged weapon with which you are proficient. It lasts until
      the end of your turn, and it has the finesse and thrown (20/60)
      properties. On a hit, it deals damage equal to failing the saving throw
      against this effect. The damage dealt by this attack doesnâ€™t include your
      Strength or Dexterity modifier.</p>
