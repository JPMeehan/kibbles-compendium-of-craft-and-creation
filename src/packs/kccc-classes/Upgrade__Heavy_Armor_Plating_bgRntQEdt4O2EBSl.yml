    value: >-
      <p>You can incorporate a suit of heavy armor into your golem, allowing it
      to calculate its armor class as if it was wearing that armor. Your golem
      is proficient with the incorporated armor, and it has disadvantage on
      Dexterity (Stealth) checks until the armor is removed. You can remove the
      incorporated armor or incorporate a new suit of armor at any time, but it
      takes twice as long as it would normally take to don or doff the
      armor.</p>
