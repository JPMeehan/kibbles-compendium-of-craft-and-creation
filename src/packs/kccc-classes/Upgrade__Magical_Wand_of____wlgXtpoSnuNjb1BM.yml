    value: >-
      <p>You create a new wand that you can infuse with a spell of 1st level or
      higher that you have recorded in your Spell Manual. This wand doesnâ€™t
      require attunement, but can only be used by you. The spell must be of a
      level that you can cast as an inventor (as of when you would choose this
      upgrade). This wand has 3 charges.</p>

      <p>You can expend a charge to cast the chosen spell at its lowest level.
      The wand regains all expended charges when you finish a long rest.</p>

      <p>You can select this upgrade multiple times, choosing a different spell
      and creating a new wand each time you select this upgrade.</p>
