      <p>Starting at 20th level, if you die you can choose to become an
      incorporeal entity on the Border Ethereal at the spot you died in the
      Material Plane at the start of your next turn. This entity has the
      physical ability scores (Strength, Dexterity, Constitution) and abilities
      of a @Compendium[dnd5e.monsters.qoFEjfrANBdrCP6m]{Ghost}, but has your
      mental ability scores (Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma) and your psion
      class abilities.</p>

      <p>When you take this form your current and maximum hit points becomes
      that of the ghost while you are in the form, if you have less than 10 psi
      points when you would assume this form, you have 10 psi points. While in
      this form you canâ€™t rest to regain spent abilities. If you exhaust all Psi
      Points or the ghost is destroyed, you die as a normal creature would.</p>
