      <p><em>Attunement, Cursed</em></p>

      <p>You create a worn magical item—such as a set of bracers, bands or a
      ring—that leverages a dark bargain. Souls for power... starting with bits
      of your own.</p>

      <p>As a bonus action, you allow allow it to feed off your own soul. You
      can decrease your Charisma ability score by up to your proficiency bonus,
      increasing your Strength ability score by an amount equal to your
      decreased Charisma. You can’t increase your Strength ability score beyond
      its normal maximum in this way. This lasts until you use an action to
      reclaim your Charisma from the item.</p>

      <p>Whenever you slay a creature of CR 1/4 or higher, you gain +1 current
      and maximum Strength ability score. Both of these effects fade after 1
      minute without killing a creature.</p>

      <p><strong>Curse:</strong> At the end of each turn your strength is
      increased by weapon, you take necrotic damage equal to 1 + the amount of
      additional maximum Strength you have gained. This damage can’t be
      resisted.</p>
