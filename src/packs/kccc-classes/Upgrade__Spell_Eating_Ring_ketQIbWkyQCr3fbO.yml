  description:
    value: "<p>You make a magical item that consumes magic around you. You can activate the item, casting counterspell or dispel magic against a target within 15 feet of you. When you cancel a spell in this way, you can consume the spell to recover 1d4 hit points per level of the spell.\_</p>\n<p>Alternatively, if the spell would have had a non-Instantaneous duration and would have affected a creature, you can transfer one spell to yourself. A spell stolen in this way doesn’t require concentration to maintain, but lasts only a number of turns equal to your Intelligence modifier or the spell’s duration, whichever is shorter.</p>\n<p>Once you use this Upgrade, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>"
