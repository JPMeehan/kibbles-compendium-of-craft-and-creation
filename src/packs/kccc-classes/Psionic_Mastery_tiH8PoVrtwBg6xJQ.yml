    value: >-
      <p>When you reach 5th level, you gain mastery of your psionic powers. At
      the start of your turn you get 1 free psi point. This can be spent to
      empower psionic disciplines, but not to recreate spells or fuel Psionic
      Talents. If you have any unspent free psi points granted by this feature
      left at the end of your turn, then they are lost.</p>

      <p>At 11th level, this is increased to 2 free psi points, and at 17th
      level, this is increased to 3. Points can be split between different
      abilities.</p>
