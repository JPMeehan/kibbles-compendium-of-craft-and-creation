      <p>As an action, you can spend 1 psi point to psionically see the aura of
      a creature of your choice within 30 feet. When you see the creatureâ€™s aura
      in this way, you can determine if there are any spells or magical effects
      affecting the creature, and you learn their schools of magic, if any. You
      can also determine if the creature is under the influence of psionics. A
      shapeshifter or creature that is transformed or disguised by magical or
      nonmagical means must make a Charisma (Deception) check against your
      Psionics save DC. On a failure, you can perceive their original form in
      their aura.</p>
