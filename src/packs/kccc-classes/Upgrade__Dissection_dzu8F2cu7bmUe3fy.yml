    value: >-
      <p>If you are holding a melee finesse weapon you have proficiency with, as
      an action you can make an Intelligence (Medicine) check against a creature
      within reach with a DC equal to its armor class. If you succeed on the
      check, you can deal damage to that creature equal to your weapon's damage
      dice plus your Intelligence modifier. On a roll of 20, treat the damage
      dice as you would on a critical hit.</p>

      <p>If you could normally make more than one weapon attack as part of the
      Attack action, you can deal a number of additional dice equal to the
      number of attacks you could normally make as part of an Attack action when
      taking this action (for example, if you have the Extra Attack feature and
      take this action with a dagger, you would deal 2d4 + your Intelligence
      modifier damage).</p>
